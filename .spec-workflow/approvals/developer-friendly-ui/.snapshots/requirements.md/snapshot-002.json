The redesign draws inspiration from x402secure.com's clean, professional dark-mode aesthetic while focusing on clarity, accessibility, and streamlined developer workflows.\n\n**Key Goals:**\n- Rebrand from SkillScan to x402guard-web\n- Create a clean, professional dark-mode interface inspired by x402secure.com\n- Make the security scanner intuitive and easy to understand\n- Provide clear documentation and integration examples\n- Break down the monolithic 743-line page into modular components\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThe x402guard platform provides pre-install security auditing for AI agent skills using the x402 payment protocol. This UI redesign supports the vision by:\n- Making security scanning accessible to developers of all skill levels\n- Reducing friction in the audit workflow\n- Building trust through transparent risk reporting\n- Showcasing the x402 payment integration seamlessly\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Rebranding & Identity\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want the platform to clearly identify as x402guard-web, so that I understand I'm using a trusted security tool aligned with the x402 ecosystem.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display \"x402guard\" as the primary brand name\n2. WHEN viewing the header THEN the system SHALL show the x402guard logo and navigation links\n3. WHEN viewing the footer THEN the system SHALL display links to the GitHub repo (goheesheng/x402guard-web) and x402 Protocol\n4. IF the user views metadata THEN the system SHALL show updated OpenGraph/SEO with x402guard branding\n\n---\n\n### Requirement 2: Dark Mode Professional Design\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean dark-mode interface similar to x402secure.com, so that I can use the tool comfortably and trust its professional quality.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a dark background with high-contrast text\n2. WHEN viewing any section THEN the system SHALL use consistent color coding (green for safe, yellow for caution, red for danger)\n3. WHEN viewing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL show clear hover states and focus indicators\n4. IF viewing on any screen size THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and visual hierarchy\n5. WHEN viewing code examples THEN the system SHALL display syntax-highlighted code blocks with copy functionality\n\n---\n\n### Requirement 3: Simplified Navigation Structure\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want intuitive navigation that helps me quickly find what I need, so that I can start scanning or integrating without confusion.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing the header THEN the system SHALL display a sticky navigation with: Overview, How It Works, Scanner, Integration, FAQ, GitHub links\n2. WHEN clicking a nav item THEN the system SHALL smooth-scroll to the corresponding section\n3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a hamburger menu with the same navigation options\n4. IF viewing the hero section THEN the system SHALL display prominent CTAs: \"Start Scanning\" and \"View Documentation\"\n\n---\n\n### Requirement 4: Clear Problem/Solution Messaging\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to immediately understand what risks x402guard protects against and how it helps, so that I can make an informed decision to use it.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing the problem section THEN the system SHALL display 3-6 risk scenarios with clear icons and descriptions\n2. WHEN viewing each risk THEN the system SHALL explain the attack vector and potential impact\n3. WHEN viewing the solution section THEN the system SHALL show how x402guard addresses each risk\n4. IF hovering over a risk card THEN the system SHALL provide additional context or examples\n\n---\n\n### Requirement 5: Intuitive Interactive Scanner\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily scan a skill URL or paste skill content, so that I can quickly assess security risks before installation.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing the scanner section THEN the system SHALL display tier options (Quick/Standard/Deep) with clear pricing and feature differences\n2. WHEN selecting a tier THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected option with visual feedback\n3. WHEN entering a skill URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format before submission\n4. WHEN pasting skill content THEN the system SHALL accept JSON/YAML/plain text formats\n5. WHEN clicking \"Scan\" THEN the system SHALL show a loading state with progress indication\n6. IF the scan requires payment (HTTP 402) THEN the system SHALL display payment instructions clearly\n7. WHEN results are ready THEN the system SHALL display:\n   - Risk score (0-100) with color-coded indicator\n   - Risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL) with clear badge\n   - Recommendation (SAFE/CAUTION/UNSAFE) with actionable guidance\n   - Detailed findings in expandable sections\n   - Attestation signature for verification\n\n---\n\n### Requirement 6: Developer-Friendly Integration Guide\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear integration examples and documentation, so that I can quickly add x402guard to my projects.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing the integration section THEN the system SHALL display code examples in multiple formats (curl, Python, JavaScript)\n2. WHEN viewing code examples THEN the system SHALL provide a copy-to-clipboard button\n3. WHEN viewing API documentation THEN the system SHALL show request/response formats for each tier\n4. IF viewing the integration section THEN the system SHALL link to the full API documentation and GitHub repo\n5. WHEN viewing examples THEN the system SHALL show both authenticated and payment flow scenarios\n\n---\n\n### Requirement 7: FAQ & Support Section\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want answers to common questions readily available, so that I can resolve issues without external support.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing the FAQ section THEN the system SHALL display expandable question/answer pairs\n2. WHEN clicking a question THEN the system SHALL smoothly expand to show the answer\n3. IF the user needs more help THEN the system SHALL display contact options (GitHub Issues, email)\n4. WHEN viewing FAQs THEN the system SHALL include questions about pricing, security, x402 protocol, and integration\n\n---\n\n### Requirement 8: Modular Component Architecture\n\n**User Story:** As a developer working on this codebase, I want well-organized, modular components, so that I can maintain and extend the application easily.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have separate component files for each major section (Hero, Problem, Solution, Scanner, Integration, FAQ, Footer)\n2. WHEN viewing shared components THEN the system SHALL have reusable UI primitives (Button, Card, CodeBlock, Badge, Input, etc.)\n3. WHEN viewing utility functions THEN the system SHALL have isolated helpers for API calls, formatting, and validation\n4. IF viewing type definitions THEN the system SHALL have centralized TypeScript types for all data structures\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component file handles one specific UI section or functionality\n- **Modular Design**: Components are isolated in `/components/` directory with clear naming\n- **Dependency Management**: Shared utilities in `/lib/` directory, types in `/types/`\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Props are typed with TypeScript, API responses have defined schemas\n\n### Performance\n- Page should load in under 2 seconds on 3G connection\n- Interactive elements should respond within 100ms\n- Animations should run at 60fps\n- Code splitting for non-critical sections\n- Images and assets should be optimized and lazy-loaded\n\n### Security\n- No sensitive data stored client-side\n- API endpoints called over HTTPS only\n- Input sanitization for URL and content fields\n- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping\n- No inline scripts or unsafe eval\n\n### Reliability\n- Graceful error handling for API failures\n- Clear error messages for user-facing errors\n- Fallback UI states for loading and error conditions\n- Offline-friendly static content (documentation, FAQ)\n\n### Usability\n- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility\n- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements\n- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels\n- Color-blind friendly indicators (not color-only)\n- Mobile-first responsive design (320px to 2560px)\n\n### Maintainability\n- ESLint and Prettier configuration for code consistency\n- Component documentation with JSDoc comments\n- Storybook-ready component structure (optional future enhancement)\n- Clear git commit conventions for change tracking\n",
