  "content": "# Requirements Document: Vulnerability Display\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis feature enhances the audit results display in the Scanner component to show vulnerabilities in a user-friendly, categorized format instead of raw JSON. After a successful x402 payment, users should see clearly organized security findings with severity indicators, descriptions, and actionable recommendations.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nSkillScan aims to be the trusted security scanner for AI skills. Displaying findings clearly helps users understand security risks and make informed decisions about which skills to use.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Categorized Vulnerability Display\n\n**User Story:** As a user who completed an audit, I want to see vulnerabilities organized by category (malware, credentials, network, permissions), so that I can quickly understand what types of issues were found.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN an audit completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display findings grouped by category (malware, credentials, network, permissions)\n2. IF a category has no findings THEN the system SHALL show a green checkmark with \"No issues found\" for that category\n3. IF a category has findings THEN the system SHALL display each finding with a severity icon and description\n4. WHEN displaying findings THEN the system SHALL use color coding: green for safe, yellow for caution, orange for warnings, red for critical\n\n### Requirement 2: Severity Indicators\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see severity levels for each vulnerability, so that I can prioritize which issues need immediate attention.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN displaying a finding THEN the system SHALL show a severity badge (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)\n2. WHEN displaying severity THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors: green (LOW), yellow (MEDIUM), orange (HIGH), red (CRITICAL)\n3. IF multiple findings exist THEN the system SHALL sort them by severity (CRITICAL first)\n\n### Requirement 3: Empty State for No Vulnerabilities\n\n**User Story:** As a user with a clean scan, I want to see a clear \"all clear\" message, so that I feel confident the skill is safe.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. IF all finding categories are empty THEN the system SHALL display a prominent success message \"No vulnerabilities detected\"\n2. WHEN showing the success state THEN the system SHALL display a large green shield/check icon\n3. WHEN showing the success state THEN the system SHALL provide a brief explanation of what was checked\n\n### Requirement 4: Transaction Confirmation Display\n\n**User Story:** As a user who paid for an audit, I want to see confirmation of my payment with a transaction link, so that I can verify the payment on-chain.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN an audit payment succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the transaction hash\n2. WHEN displaying the transaction THEN the system SHALL provide a clickable link to BaseScan\n3. WHEN displaying the transaction THEN the system SHALL show the amount paid and network (Base)\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Create a separate `VulnerabilityDisplay` component for findings visualization\n- **Modular Design**: Components should be reusable for different audit tiers\n- **Dependency Management**: Use existing UI components (Card, Badge) from the design system\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define typed props for all vulnerability display components\n\n### Performance\n- Findings display should render within 100ms\n- No unnecessary re-renders when other state changes\n\n### Security\n- Transaction links should use `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` for external links\n- No sensitive data exposed in the UI\n\n### Reliability\n- Handle edge cases: null findings, malformed data, missing fields\n- Graceful degradation if attestation or transaction data is missing\n\n### Usability\n- Mobile-responsive layout for findings display\n- Clear visual hierarchy with appropriate spacing\n- Accessible color contrast ratios for severity indicators\n",
